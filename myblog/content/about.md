# Hi there

My name is Murat and I have been working as a software developer in a Denmark based telecommunication company for 4 years. In may professional life I use **.Net** frameworks and write codes with **C#**. 
But out of my professional life, I try to use various technologies like **Python**, **Dart** for **Flutter**and sometimes JavaScript frameworks as React and a little bit React Native but after met with Flutter I gave up it.

In this blog I will try to write the diffuculties I faced and the solutions for these diffuculties so this blog will be totaly technical and reminder for me to go back and remind the solution. I hope it will be usefull for you as well.
